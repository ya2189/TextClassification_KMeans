These component graphs show the results of one of the matrices obtained from LSA, or Truncated SVD. I focused on 100 components or mathematical “concepts” for this analysis. These mathematical “concepts” are what the terms are associated with and are grouped by. Analyzing rows of the matrix V, from the decomposition of the sparse matrix, it is evident that most of the terms associated with a concept are similar to each other. For example, in component 29, some of the strongest terms in the component are “debt”, “tax”, “stock”, which are all similar terms that have to do with money or finances. In component 14, the strongest terms include “Reagan”, “president”, “chief”, “securities”, “executive”, and “officer, which all relate to the government, or government positions (see Appendix D).
