These scatterplots are visualizations of the K-means clustering algorithm, where entroids are randomly placed on a scatter plot of the data points, and the distance between the data point and the centroid is calculated. Then, the data point is associated with the closest centroid. The average of the distances is taken and the centroids are moved so that it is at the center of the closest data points. Doing this repeatedly creates “clusters” around the centroids. The “k” in the K-means algorithm correlates with the number of clusters.
